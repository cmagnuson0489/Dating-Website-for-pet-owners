- This will be my repository for a dating website that I am currently building.

- This website will be catered towards people who have pets and are looking for a romantic partner with the same interests as well.

- I am contemplating using Mongo DB for my Database needs.

- In the first implementation this will be only be a web based application but in the future I plan on making it available on for mobile for both Apple and  Android.

- I plan on using Amazon S3 for my Cloud storage needs but there is also the possibility of using Google Cloud depending on the price difference.'

- The main programming languages I plan on using are JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.
